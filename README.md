Hi there!
My name is Kevin and I am a student at Missouri State Univeristy. This is my first attempt on baby steps to become a professional front-end web developer. I certainly believe that this is the right choice and the right call for me. I am willing to contribute effort, energy and determination to be sucess and it is no way I am backing down from this fight for my future.
It's always best to start with a humble beginings.
Sincere,
Kevin N.
